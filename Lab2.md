1.)


2.) First off, it's important to choose a license because a program that does not have a license explicitly associated with itself, the licensing is considered "all rights reserved". However, just choosing any license without careful thought as a developer can be just as bad. A license allows a developer choice in how they may see their software grow and evolve down the road. Questions such as if you want your software to be available for commercial development, if you want people to be able to add future restrictions to the software, or how you want your software to be packaged are questions that should be considered.

3.) By default any software/project that isn't explicitly stated to have a license is considered "all rights reserved", the strictest of all levels. Any use of the project in your own legally requires explicit permission from the owner of said project. Often times it can be a hassle to acquire that permission and can halt progress on your own project.

4.) I agree with the author's claim that Gopher failed and HTTP survived for the reasons that he mentions. The work performed by a large collective unit such as the developers of the Web allows for a project to be worked on constantly. Iteration after iteration, the project starts to not only address bugs and problems but branches out to do more than what it was imagined to do originally. 

5.) The linux kernel is currently licensed uner the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. That means that the modifications to the linux kernel that are published by other users are available for distribution to other users under the same license/terms. This amount of control is important when developing a very popular project so that all work/modifications done are more than not, to enhance the user experience. An interesting thing to note is that Linux offers the use of its trademarked name in modifications free of charge, possibly to enhance brand recognition.

6 & 7.) GPL, LGPL, Apache/BSD 

	for developer - not Apache (explicitly restricts use of trademarks), LGPL (Library may be used in non-open source software)
	for company - not GPL (does not allow sublicensing), LGPL (Library may be used in non-open source software), Apache (restriction of trademark helps them)
	for common good - Apache & GPL (requires state changes), GPL (disclose open source code), BSD (no warranty/very permissive)
