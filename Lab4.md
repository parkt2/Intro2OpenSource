1.	Within the upgrade guide for OpenBSD (specifically the guide detailing 4.0 to 4.1), I found a subject-verb disagreement under the header "Before upgrading". The use of the verb "requires" didn't agree with the use of the noun "Changes". I submitted a fix to change "requires" to "require" to make the sentence grammatically correct. 

2.	Good documentation is important to have because it facilitates an effective working environment. This is especially important when the project being worked on is a large one, and when documentation is one of the main ways of communicating between members working on the project. Good documentation allows developers to get software running quickly and correctly, like oiling the gears of a machine. People run into less hiccups, get less frustrated, and will naturally be motivated to put more into the project. "Good documentation enables good code. Good code enables good documentation".

3.	In our last class, we held a debate about between the use of open source software and proprietary software. Professor Krishnamoorthy started off the debate as a supporter of proprietary software and made a compelling argument that left most of the class unable to counter-argue. The main takeaway from his argument that I received was that sometimes in order to do a substantial amount of "good", one must first do "bad". "Good" in this case being acts such as humanitarian work and donating huge sums of money, while "bad" meant selling propietary software (and doing anything to capitalize on doing so). His main example was Bill Gates. There were a few arguments made for the use of Open Source, however. In Open Source software, there are more freedoms involved for the individual. The way the software is structured as well allows for fluid change and distribution (for the developers).
