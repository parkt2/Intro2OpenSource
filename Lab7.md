		Authors "MikeMacelletti" and "Mike Macelletti" were considered separate

#Lapsus Linguae (Kevin Zhang)

Github:
====
\# contributors: 7
\# LoC: 167

First commit: 2015-01-31

Gitstats:
====
\# contributors: 10
\# LoC: 169

First commit: 2015-01-31
Last commit: 2015-10-20

Notes: Looks like gitstats duped 3 people, using their full name and their github username as two different people. No idea where the 2 extra lines of code come from.
