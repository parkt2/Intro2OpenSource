In our Project FE:CLI, we have been successfully able to parse the written data of the original game and store that information into custom classes that hold information about characters and items. We are currently working on how map movements will work, and implementing save states for the game as well as, saving preferences throughout the game. We've also successfully loaded the title of the game in ASCII art.
